<Heading> My thoughts on turborepo</Heading>

It's been a long time since <Link href='https://github.com/vercel/turbo'>Vercel</Link>   released a hyped monorepo member and task runner called <Link href="https://turbo.build/repo">Turborepo</Link>.
I watched  a small talk from  <Link href='https://www.youtube.com/@leerob'>Leerob's channel</Link> where he was hosting Jared palmer, the founder of turbo. It is  very interesting and it ended up
 convincing me to switch  to turborepos instead of my `yarn workspaces` for monorepo(ised) projects.
