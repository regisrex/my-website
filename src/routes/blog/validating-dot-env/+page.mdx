<Heading> Validating environment variables </Heading>
<H3>Intro </H3>
A lot of backend developers meet this kind of error where they try to use an environment variable which is not set or which is 
invalid. For example, if you are implementing auth with jsonwebtoken, you should set `JWT_SECRET` in you envirnment variables. In this small blog, I'll share the way that I use 
to ensure that all required environment variables are valid and available using <Link href="https://zod.dev">zod</Link>  

<H3> The problem I'm trying to solve</H3>
Let's try to understand the reason why I do this


```javascript
require('dotenv').config()

export function generatToken(user){
  return jwt.sign({ 
    _id: user._id,
    role: user.role },
    process.env.JWT_SECRET,    //  non-validated env. variable was used here
    { expiresIn: "1d" }
  );
}
```
This code above is not sure that `process.env.JWT_ACCESS_TOKEN` is defined and is a valid jwt secret key, and this
can cause problems when this function is called like what happened to me down here!
  
<H3> The solution I use </H3>  

To validate envirnment variables with zod, we need to first create a validation schema that we'll use to validate of course and then we'll directly trigger
the validation when the module is loaded ( not when the function using an environment variables in invoked ).  
I somehow recommend typescript to keep the type definitions that zod generated for use

<br/> 


Let's try it
```typescript
// filename : @/utils/env.ts
import { config } from 'dotenv'
import z from 'zod'
config()  // looad values in .env file into system environment variables

const envSchema = z.object({
  JWT_SECRET: z.string().min(10 , "Please use a long jwt secret")
})

// validates and parses `process.env`and return an object or throw an error when the variables are invalid
const env = envSchema.parse({ ...process.env })
export default env  
```
This ensures that this variable `JWT_SECRET` is defined and valid before bootstraping the app. Make sure that this file is the only one that uses `process.env` object in your source code. Otherwise, you'll be using unvalidated environment variables.

Next, let's see how to use our validated env.
```typescript 
// filename: @/middlewares/verifyToken.ts

import env from "@/utils/env"
import jwt from 'jsonwebtoken'
export function verifyToken(req,res,next){
  try{
    const token = req.headers.authorization;
    const decoded = await jwt.verify(token, env.JWT_SECRET) // now we're sure that this is available and valid
    req.user = decoded
    next()
  }catch(error : any){
    // handle error
    return res.status(401).send("Unauthorized")
  }
}
```
And this can ensure us that we have not only defined but also valid envirnment variables to use in our app.

<H3> More use  cases </H3>
I used a simple example to demonstrate the way I use but we can take this to another level, for example validating database connection strings , smtp credentials and more.


<H3> Outro </H3>
I wrote this to share this practice as I think can reduce the number of times the server crashes due to env variables. I used zod because 
it is my best validation library but you can use any your want, the concept is to trigger validation directly when the module is loaded.
