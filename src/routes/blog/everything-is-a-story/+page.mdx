Nobody likes it when you have wrote some bullshit code like you don't know what is maintainability, 
If I were a code reviewer for the team, the best thing I can do for you is to give you  a seperate git repository to 
work from, because I can not take my time to requiest 10 changes on a single 20-lines pull request.  Your code should be undertandable, that is a must.


<H3> Why write this? </H3>
I recently heard a colleague  talking about his coworker who writes 10 React components in a single file while one of the best answers to the question 'Why React?' is "Seperation of concerns". I understand
 you might be running out of time or the kinda-lazy, It's okay, we're all human. But, we should craft our products extremely well.

<i> Bad code sample </i>

```jsx
/* Example
 *
 * Imagine  a 4-level nested if statement block
*/

 I like watching devlogs on  youtube,  currently I like <Link href="https://youtube.com/withmarko">Marko</Link>, 
 he teaches me a lot of things that can help me in my career growth and it is where I learnt that the difference between good and great is only "one round of more revision". So I'm now learning and adopting this habit of code revision and refactorinig before a push.


<H3> How to write clean code </H3>

Whether on backend or on frontend, There's one thing that surely works well, <b class='font-medium text-bluish-100'> writing code like you're   writing a  story. </b>  I believe people who  made intrepreters and compilers wrote them in such a way  that the program is  story of what is happening. 
We all know what happens when the game in a story has too much conditions to  check (if statements) and also when the same scenes keep repeating, we go for another story.

<H3> My outro</H3>
 Write your code like  you're telling a story, I work hard that your story shoulld neither be boring nor overwhelming
